# The Color Psychology of Pink
Pink is a light red hue and is typically associated with love and romance. It is often described as a feminine color, perhaps due to associations people form during early childhood. "Girls toys" are usually pink and purple, while "boys toys" are often red, yellow, green, or blue. People associate the color with qualities that are often thought of as feminine, such as softness, kindness, nurturance, and compassion.

Pink is thought to have a calming effect.1﻿ One shade known as "drunk-tank pink" is sometimes used in prisons to calm inmates.

While pink's calming effect has been demonstrated, researchers of color psychology have found that this effect only occurs during the initial exposure to the color.1﻿ When used in prisons, inmates often become even more agitated once they become accustomed to the color.
